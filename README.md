# MusicFunctions

A book on the functions of music.

# WHY

This book stems out from a long seeking for such an argumentation. Funnily
enough, I could not find any (please feel free to prove me wrong by writing an
issue [here](https://github.com/nicb/MusicFunctions/issues)). So I set up to write it myself.
As you can see I am **far** from done yet, so you are welcome to fork it and
issue pull requests if you feel so inclined. All contributions will be
acknowledged in authorship.
