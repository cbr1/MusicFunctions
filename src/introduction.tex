\section{Introduction}

The idea that music should be something that soothes our soul, that has to
please us and relieve us from the hardships of our daily chores is similar to
the idea that the function of food is that of nutrition and
that making love is done for procreation purposes.

In our contemporary society, nothing could be farther from truth.
